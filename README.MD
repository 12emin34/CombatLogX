# CombatLogX
CombatLogX is a simple combat tagging plugin  
You can also abbreviate it as CLX  
For planned features, you can check the 'To Do.list' file

## Version Information
The format is as follows:
*major*.*minor*.*patch*.*expansion*  
*expansion* will change when an expansion is changed or updated  
*patch* will change when I make small changes that don't affect anything major  
*minor* will change when I add a new expansion or create more effective changes  
*major* will change when I modify the API or make a lot of changes that affect the plugin  

## Expansion Information
Expansions are similar to plugins, but instead of going in */plugins/* they go in */plugins/CombatLogX/expansions/*  
They can be used to add new features to CombatLogX or add Compatibility with other plugins  
  
More information about expansions can be found here: [CombatLogX Wiki](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/combatlogx/)

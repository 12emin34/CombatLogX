[SIZE=5][B][COLOR=#FF0000]Description:[/COLOR][/B][/SIZE]
CombatLogX is an awesome plugin that can be used to punish players that leave during combat.
The plugin is very configurable and even uses an expansion system to prevent unwanted features from wasting server resources.

[SIZE=5][B][COLOR=#FF0000]Expansions:[/COLOR][/B][/SIZE]
All expansions that are created by SirBlobman will be included inside of the CombatLogX.zip file.
If you need more information about these expansions, you can visit the [URL="https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/combatlogx/"]Spigot Wiki[/URL]

[SIZE=5][B][COLOR=#FF0000]Installation Guide:[/COLOR][/B][/SIZE]
CombatLogX is not like all other plugins, please follow the guide below to install it correctly:
[LIST=1]
[*] Download the CombatLogX.zip file into a folder on your computer using the DOWNLOAD button above.
[*] Extract the [U]CombatLogX.zip[/U] file into the folder that you created.
[*] Open the folder you created and delete any expansion jars that you don't need from [U]<folder>/CombatLogX/expansions/[/U].
[*] Upload the contents of the folder you created into the [U]/plugins/[/U] folder of your server.
[*] Start your server so that the configuration files can be generated properly.
[*] Stop your server and modify all the configuration files with the settings that you want. Expansions have their own configs so don't forget to check those as well.
[*] Start your server. CombatLogX should be working now. If you need help or find bugs please report them in my Discord or on my GitHub page.

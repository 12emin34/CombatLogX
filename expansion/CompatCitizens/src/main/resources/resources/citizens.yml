  # This will only work if the 'npc type' is PLAYER, otherwise it will be ignored
  # Set this to true if you want the inventory of the player who logged out to be placed into the NPC instead of being dropped
  # Default: true
  store inventory: true

  # How long should the plugin wait (in seconds) to remove the NPC after the player logs out
  # Set this to -1 to make the NPC stay forever
  # The NPC will be automatically removed if it dies or the player logs back in
  # Default: 30
  survival time: 30

  # Should the plugin convert the NPCs to Sentinels?

  # Sentinel can be found here: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/sentinel.22017/

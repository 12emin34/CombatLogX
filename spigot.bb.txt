[B]Q: Why are players getting tagged by cactus / lava / fall damage / drowning / non-pvp damage?[/B]
[B]A:[/B] Check your configuration for the NotCombatLogX Expansion at [ICODE]/plugins/CombatLogX/expansions/NotCombatLogX/not.yml[/ICODE]

[B]Q: How do I prevent people from running commands, flying, using elytra, etc...?[/B]
[B]A:[/B] You have to install and configure the CheatPrevention expansion and configure the file at [ICODE]/plugins/CombatLogX/expansions/Cheat Prevention/cheat prevention.yml[/ICODE]

[B]Q: Why do I keep getting an error [U]Jar dooes not contain plugin.yml[/U]?[/B]
[B]A:[/B] Expansions are not plugins, make sure you put them in [U]/plugins/CombatLogX/expansions/[/U].

[B]Q: Why are the placeholders not being replaced?[/B]
[B]A:[/B] Make sure you installed the "Placeholder Compatibility" expansion.

[B]Q: Why can't I see the BossBar in 1.8?[/B]
[B]A:[/B] 1.8 is extremely outdated. If you still want to use the BossBar, you will need to install BossBarAPI.
